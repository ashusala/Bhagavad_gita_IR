      "The text:  ['Dhrtarastra said O Sanjaya after my sons and the sons of Pandu assembled in the place of pilgrimage at Kuruksetra desiring to fight what did they do', 'Sanjaya said O King after looking over the army arranged in military formation by the sons of Pandu King Duryodhana went to his teacher and spoke the following words', 'O my teacher behold the great army of the sons of Pandu so expertly arranged by your intelligent disciple the son of Drupada', 'Here in this army are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna great fighters like Yuyudhana Virata and Drupada', 'There are also great heroic powerful fighters like Dhrstaketu Cekitana Kasiraja Purujit Kuntibhoja and Saibya', 'There are the mighty Yudhamanyu the very powerful Uttamauja the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadi All these warriors are great chariot fighters', 'But for your information O best of the brahmanas let me tell you about the captains who are especially qualified to lead my military force', 'There are personalities like you Bhisma Karna Krpa Asvatthama Vikarna and the son of Somadatta called Bhurisrava who are always victorious in battle', 'There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons and all are experienced in military science', 'Our strength is immeasurable and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bhisma whereas the strength of the Pandavas carefully protected by Bhima is limited', 'All of you must now give full support to Grandfather Bhisma as you stand at your respective strategic points of entrance into the phalanx of the army', 'Then Bhisma the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty the grandfather of the fighters blew his conchshell very loudly making a sound like the roar of a lion giving Duryodhana joy', 'After that the conchshells drums bugles trumpets and horns were all suddenly sounded and the combined sound was tumultuous', 'On the other side both Lord Krsna and Arjuna stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses sounded their transcendental conchshells', 'Lord Krsna blew His conchshell called Pancajanya Arjuna blew his the Devadatta and Bhima the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks blew his terrific conchshell called Paundra', 'King Yudhisthira the son of Kunti blew his conchshell the Anantavijaya and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosa and Manipuspaka That great archer the King of Kasi the great fighter Sikhandi Dhrstadyumna Virata the unconquerable Satyaki Drupada the sons of Draupadi and others O King such as the mightyarmed son of Subhadra all blew their respective conchshells', 'The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious Vibrating both in the sky and on the earth it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhrtarastra', 'At that time Arjuna the son of Pandu seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanuman took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows O King after looking at the sons of Dhrtarastra drawn in military array Arjuna then spoke to Lord Krsna these words', 'Arjuna said O infallible one please draw my chariot between the two armies so that I may see those present here who desire to fight and with whom I must contend in this great trial of arms', 'Let me see those who have come here to fight wishing to please the evilminded son of Dhrtarastra', 'Sanjaya said O descendant of Bharata having thus been addressed by Arjuna Lord Krsna drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties', 'In the presence of Bhisma Drona and all the other chieftains of the world the Lord said Just behold Partha all the Kurus assembled here', 'There Arjuna could see within the midst of the armies of both parties his fathers grandfathers teachers maternal uncles brothers sons grandsons friends and also his fathersinlaw and wellwishers', 'When the son of Kunti Arjuna saw all these different grades of friends and relatives he became overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus', 'Arjuna said My dear Krsna seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up', 'My whole body is trembling my hair is standing on end my bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand and my skin is burning', 'I am now unable to stand here any longer I am forgetting myself and my mind is reeling I see only causes of misfortune O Krsna killer of the Kesi demon', 'I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle nor can I my dear Krsna desire any subsequent victory kingdom or happiness', 'O Govinda of what avail to us are a kingdom happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this battlefield O Madhusudana when teachers fathers sons grandfathers maternal uncles fathersinlaw grandsons brothersinlaw and other relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me why should I wish to kill them even though they might otherwise kill me O maintainer of all living entities I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds let alone this earth What pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhrtarastra', 'Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra and our friends What should we gain O Krsna husband of the goddess of fortune and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen', 'O Janardana although these men their hearts overtaken by greed see no fault in killing ones family or quarreling with friends why should we who can see the crime in destroying a family engage in these acts of sin', 'With the destruction of the dynasty the eternal family tradition is vanquished and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion', 'When irreligion is prominent in the family O Krsna the women of the family become polluted and from the degradation of womanhood O descendant of Vrsni comes unwanted progeny', 'An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition The ancestors of such corrupt families fall down because the performances for offering them food and water are entirely stopped', 'By the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted children all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated', 'O Krsna maintainer of the people I have heard by disciplic succession that those whose family traditions are destroyed dwell always in hell', 'Alas how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts Driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness we are intent on killing our own kinsmen', 'Better for me if the sons of Dhrtarastra weapons in hand were to kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield', 'Sanjaya said Arjuna having thus spoken on the battlefield cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot his mind overwhelmed with grief', 'Sanjaya said Seeing Arjuna full of compassion his mind depressed his eyes full of tears Madhusudana Krsna spoke the following words', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead said My dear Arjuna how have these impurities come upon you They are not at all befitting a man who knows the value of life They lead not to higher planets but to infamy', 'O son of Prtha do not yield to this degrading impotence It does not become you Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise O chastiser of the enemy', 'Arjuna said O killer of enemies O killer of Madhu how can I counterattack with arrows in battle men like Bhisma and Drona who are worthy of my worship', 'It would be better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the lives of great souls who are my teachers Even though desiring worldly gain they are superiors If they are killed everything we enjoy will be tainted with blood', 'Nor do we know which is better  conquering them or being conquered by them If we killed the sons of Dhrtarastra we should not care to live Yet they are now standing before us on the battlefield', 'Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of miserly weakness In this condition I am asking You to tell me for certain what is best for me Now I am Your disciple and a soul surrendered unto You Please instruct me', 'I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses I will not be able to dispel it even if I win a prosperous unrivaled kingdom on earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven', 'Sanjaya said Having spoken thus Arjuna chastiser of enemies told Krsna Govinda I shall not fight and fell silent', 'O descendant of Bharata at that time Krsna smiling in the midst of both the armies spoke the following words to the griefstricken Arjuna', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead said While speaking learned words you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead', 'Never was there a time when I did not exist nor you nor all these kings nor in the future shall any of us cease to be', 'As the embodied soul continuously passes in this body from boyhood to youth to old age the soul similarly passes into another body at death A sober person is not bewildered by such a change', 'O son of Kunti the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress and their disappearance in due course are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons They arise from sense perception O scion of Bharata and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed', 'O best among men Arjuna the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberation', 'Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent the material body there is no endurance and of the eternal the soul there is no change This they have concluded by studying the nature of both', 'That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul', 'The material body of the indestructible immeasurable and eternal living entity is sure to come to an end therefore fight O descendant of Bharata', 'Neither he who thinks the living entity the slayer nor he who thinks it slain is in knowledge for the self slays not nor is slain', 'For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time He has not come into being does not come into being and will not come into being He is unborn eternal everexisting and primeval He is not slain when the body is slain', 'O Partha how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible eternal unborn and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to kill', 'As a person puts on new garments giving up old ones the soul similarly accepts new material bodies giving up the old and useless ones', 'The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon nor burned by fire nor moistened by water nor withered by the wind', 'This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble and can be neither burned nor dried He is everlasting present everywhere unchangeable immovable and eternally the same', 'It is said that the soul is invisible inconceivable and immutable Knowing this you should not grieve for the body', 'If however you think that the soul or the symptoms of life will always be born and die forever you still have no reason to lament O mightyarmed', 'One who has taken his birth is sure to die and after death one is sure to take birth again Therefore in the unavoidable discharge of your duty you should not lament', 'All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning manifest in their interim state and unmanifest again when annihilated So what need is there for lamentation', 'Some look on the soul as amazing some describe him as amazing and some hear of him as amazing while others even after hearing about him cannot understand him at all', 'O descendant of Bharata he who dwells in the body can never be slain Therefore you need not grieve for any living being', 'Considering your specific duty as a ksatriya you should know that there is no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles and so there is no need for hesitation',

will conquer and enjoy the earthly kingdom Therefore get up with determination and fight', 'Do thou fight for the sake of fighting without considering happiness or distress loss or gain victory or defeat  and by so doing you shall never incur sin', 'Thus far I have described this knowledge to you through analytical study Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results O son of Prtha when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works', 'In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear', 'Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose and their aim is one O beloved child of the Kurus the intelligence of those who are irresolute is manybranched', 'Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets resultant good birth power

Arjuna abandoning all attachment to success or failure Such equanimity is called yoga', 'O Dhananjaya keep all abominable activities far distant by devotional service and in that consciousness surrender unto the Lord Those who want to enjoy the fruits of their work are misers', 'A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad reactions even in this life Therefore strive for yoga which is the art of all work', 'By thus engaging in devotional service to the Lord great sages or devotees free themselves from the results of work in the material world In this way they become free from the cycle of birth and death and attain the state beyond all miseries by going back to Godhead', 'When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard', 'When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas and when it remains fixed in the trance of selfrealization then you will have attained the divine consciousness', 'Arjuna said O Krsna what are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus merged in transcendence How does he speak and what is his language How does he sit and how does he walk', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead said O Partha when a man gives up all varieties of desire for sense gratification which arise from mental concoction and when his mind thus purified finds satisfaction in the self alone then he is said to be in pure transcendental consciousness', 'One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness and who is free from attachment fear and anger is called a sage of steady mind', 'In the material world one who is unaffected by whatever good or evil he may obtain neither praising it nor despising it is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge', 'One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects as the tortoise draws its limbs within the shell is firmly fixed in perfect consciousness', 'Though the embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment the taste for sense objects remains But ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste he is fixed in consciousness', 'The senses are so strong and impetuous O Arjuna that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them', 'One who restrains his senses keeping them under full control and fixes his consciousness upon Me is known as a man of steady intelligence', 'While contemplating the objects of the senses a person develops attachment for them and from such attachment lust develops and from lust anger arises', 'From anger complete delusion arises and from delusion bewilderment of memory When memory is bewildered intelligence is lost and when intelligence is lost one falls down again into the material pool', 'But a person free from all attachment and aversion and able to control his senses through regulative principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord', 'For one thus satisfied in Krsna consciousness the threefold miseries of material existence exist no longer in such satisfied consciousness ones intelligence is soon well established', 'One who is not connected with the Supreme in Krsna consciousness can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind without which there is no possibility of peace And how can there be any happiness without peace', 'As a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a mans intelligence', 'Therefore O mightyarmed one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence', 'What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the selfcontrolled and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage', 'A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires  that enter like rivers into the ocean

free from desires who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego  he alone can attain real peace', 'That is the way of the spiritual and godly life after attaining which a man is not bewildered If one is thus situated even at the hour of death one can enter into the kingdom of God', 'Arjuna said O Janardana O Kesava why do You want to engage me in this ghastly warfare if You think that intelligence is better than fruitive work', 'My intelligence is bewildered by Your equivocal instructions Therefore please tell me decisively which will be most beneficial for me', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead said O sinless Arjuna I have already explained that there are two classes of men who try to realize the self Some are inclined to understand it by empirical philosophical speculation and others by devotional service', 'Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection', 'Everyone is forced to act helplessly according to the qualities he has acquired from the modes of material nature therefore no one can refrain from doing something not even for a moment', 'One who restrains the senses of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender', 'On the other hand if a sincere person tries to control the active senses by the mind and begins karmayoga in Krsna consciousness without attachment he is by far superior', 'Perform your prescribed duty for doing so is better than not working One cannot even maintain ones physical body without work', 'Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed otherwise work causes bondage in this material world Therefore O son of Kunti perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction and in that way you will always remain free from bondage', 'In the beginning of creation the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations of men and demigods along with sacrifices for Visnu and blessed them by saying Be thou happy by this yajna sacrifice because its performance will bestow upon you everything desirable for living happily and achieving liberation', 'The demigods being pleased by sacrifices will also please you and thus by cooperation between men and demigods prosperity will reign for all', 'In charge of the various necessities of life the demigods being satisfied by the performance of yajna sacrifice will supply all necessities to you But he who enjoys such gifts without offering them to the demigods in return is certainly a thief', 'The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice Others who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment verily eat only sin', 'All living bodies subsist on food grains which are produced from rains Rains are produced by performance of yajna sacrifice and yajna is born of prescribed duties', 'Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead Consequently the allpervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice', 'My dear Arjuna one who does not follow in human life the cycle of sacrifice thus established by the Vedas certainly leads a life full of sin Living only for the satisfaction of the senses such a person lives in vain', 'But for one who takes pleasure in the Self whose human life is one of selfrealization and who is satisfied in the Self only fully satiated  for him there is no duty', 'A selfrealized man has no purpose to fulfill in the discharge of his prescribed duties nor has he any reason not to perform such work Nor has he any need to depend on any other living being', 'Therefore without being attached to the fruits of activities one should act as a matter of duty for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme', 'Kings such as Janaka attained perfection solely by performance of prescribed duties Therefore just for the sake of educating the people in general you should perform your work', 'Whatever action a great man performs common men follow And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts all the world pursues', 'O son of Prtha there is no work prescribed for Me within all the three planetary systems Nor am I in want of anything nor have I a need to obtain anything  and yet I am engaged in prescribed duties', 'For if I ever failed to engage in carefully performing prescribed duties O Partha certainly all men would follow My path', 'If I did not perform prescribed duties all these worlds would be put to ruination I would be the cause of creating unwanted population and I would thereby destroy the peace of all living beings', 'As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results the learned may similarly act but without attachment for the sake of leading people on the right path', 'So as not to disrupt the minds of ignorant men attached to the fruitive results of prescribed duties a learned person should not induce them to stop work Rather by working in the spirit of devotion he should engage them in all sorts of activities for the gradual development of Krsna consciousness', 'The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature', 'One who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth O mightyarmed does not engage himself in the senses and sense gratification knowing well the differences between work in devotion and work for fruitive results', 'Bewildered by the modes of material nature the ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and become attached But the wise should not unsettle them although these duties are inferior due to the performers lack of knowledge', 'Therefore O Arjuna surrendering all your works unto Me with full knowledge of Me without desires for profit with no claims to proprietorship and free from lethargy fight', 'Those persons who execute their duties according to My injunctions and who follow this teaching faithfully without envy become free from the bondage of fruitive actions', 'But those who out of envy disregard these teachings and do not follow them regularly are to be considered bereft of all knowledge befooled and ruined in their endeavors for perfection', 'Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature for everyone follows the nature he has acquired from the three modes What can repression accomplish', 'There are principles to regulate attachment and aversion pertaining to the senses and their objects One should not come under the control of such attachment and aversion because they are stumbling blocks on the path of selfrealization', 'It is far better to discharge ones prescribed duties even though faultily than anothers duties perfectly Destruction in the course of performing ones own duty is better than engaging in anothers duties for to follow anothers path is dangerous', 'Arjuna said O descendant of Vrsni by what is one impelled to sinful acts even unwillingly as if engaged by force', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead said It is lust only Arjuna which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath and which is the alldevouring sinful enemy of this world', 'As fire is covered by smoke as a mirror is covered by dust or as the embryo is covered by the womb the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust', 'Thus the wise living entitys pure consciousness becomes covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust which is never satisfied and which burns like fire', 'The senses the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him', 'Therefore O Arjuna best of the Bharatas in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin lust by regulating the senses and slay this destroyer of knowledge and selfrealization', 'The working senses are superior to dull matter mind is higher than the senses intelligence is still higher than the mind and he the soul is even higher than the intelligence', 'Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to the material senses mind and intelligence O mightyarmed Arjuna one should steady the mind by deliberate spiritual intelligence Krsna consciousness and thus  by spiritual strength  conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust', 'The Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna said I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sungod Vivasvan and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu the father of mankind and Manu in turn instructed it to Iksvaku', 'This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession and the saintly kings understood it in that way But in course of time the succession was broken and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost', 'That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend and can therefore understand the transcendental mystery of this science', 'Arjuna said The sungod Vivasvan is senior by birth to You How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him', 'The Personality of Godhead said Many many births both you and I have passed I can remember all of them but you cannot O subduer of the enemy', 'Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates and although I am the Lord of all living entities I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form', 'Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice O descendant of Bharata and a predominant rise of irreligion  at that time I descend Myself', 'To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants as well as to reestablish the principles of religion I Myself appear millennium after millennium', 'One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not upon leaving the body take his birth again in this material world but attains My eternal abode O Arjuna', 'Being freed from attachment fear and anger being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me many many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me  and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me', 'As all surrender unto Me I reward them accordingly Everyone follows My path in all respects O son of Prtha', 'Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities and therefore they worship the demigods Quickly of course men get results from fruitive work in this world', 'According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated with them the four divisions of human society are created by Me And although I am the creator of this system you should know that I am yet the nondoer being unchangeable', 'There is no work that affects Me nor do I aspire for the fruits of action One who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work', 'All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding of My transcendental nature

knowing which you shall be liberated from all misfortune', 'The intricacies of action are very hard to understand Therefore one should know properly what action is what forbidden action is and what inaction is', 'One who sees inaction in action and action in inaction is intelligent among men and he is in the transcendental position although engaged in all sorts of activities', 'One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every endeavor is devoid of desire for sense gratification He is said by sages to be a worker for whom the reactions of work have been burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge', 'Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities ever satisfied and independent he performs no fruitive action although engaged in all kinds of undertakings', 'Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly controlled gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions and acts only for the bare necessities of life Thus working he is not affected by sinful reactions', 'He who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord who is free from duality and does not envy who is steady in both success and failure is never entangled

who is fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same spiritual nature', 'Some yogis perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them and some offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman', 'Some the unadulterated brahmacaris sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of mental control and others the regulated householders sacrifice the objects of the senses in the fire of the senses', 'Others who are interested in achieving selfrealization through control of the mind and senses offer the functions of all the senses and of the life breath as oblations into the fire of the controlled mind', 'Having accepted strict vows some become enlightened by sacrificing their possessions and others by performing severe austerities by practicing the yoga of eightfold mysticism or by studying the Vedas to advance in transcendental knowledge', 'Still others who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance practice by offering the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming and the incoming breath into the outgoing and thus at last remain in trance stopping all breathing Others curtailing the eating process offer the outgoing breath into itself as a sacrifice', 'All these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful reactions and having tasted the nectar of the results of sacrifices they advance toward the supreme eternal atmosphere', 'O best of the Kuru dynasty without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life what then of the next', 'All these different types of sacrifice are approved by the Vedas and all of them are born of different types of work Knowing them as such you will become liberated', 'O chastiser of the enemy the sacrifice performed in knowledge is better than the mere sacrifice of material possessions After all O son of Prtha all sacrifices of work culminate in transcendental knowledge', 'Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him The selfrealized souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth', 'Having obtained real knowledge from a selfrealized soul you will never fall again into such illusion for by this knowledge you will see that all living beings are but part of the Supreme or in other words that they are Mine', 'Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners when you are situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries', 'As a blazing fire turns firewood to ashes O Arjuna so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions to material activities', 'In this world there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge Such knowledge is the mature fruit of all mysticism And one who has become accomplished in the practice of devotional service enjoys this knowledge within himself in due course of time', 'A faithful man who is dedicated to transcendental knowledge and who subdues his senses is eligible to achieve such knowledge and having achieved it he quickly attains the supreme spiritual peace', 'But ignorant and

to him Though always working such a man is never entangled', 'A person in the divine consciousness although engaged in seeing hearing touching smelling eating moving about sleeping and breathing

with their objects and that he is aloof from them', 'One who performs his duty without attachment surrendering the results unto the Supreme Lord is unaffected by sinful action as the lotus leaf is untouched by water', 'The yogis abandoning attachment act with body mind intelligence and even with the senses only for the purpose of purification', 'The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated

equal mind', 'A transcendentalist should always engage his body mind and self in relationship with the Supreme he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully control his mind He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness', 'To practice yoga one should go to a secluded place and should lay kusa grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth The seat should be neither too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place The yogi should then sit on it very firmly and practice yoga to purify the heart by controlling his mind

yoga', 'As a lamp in a windless place does not waver so the transcendentalist whose mind is controlled remains always steady in his meditation on the transcendent Self', 'In the stage of perfection called trance or samadhi ones mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga This perfection is characterized by ones ability to see the Self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the Self In that joyous state one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness realized through transcendental senses Established thus one never departs from the truth and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain Being situated in such a position one is never shaken even in the midst of greatest difficulty This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact', 'One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with determination and faith and not be deviated from the path One should abandon without exception all material desires born of mental speculation and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind', 'Gradually step by step one should become situated in trance by means of intelligence sustained by full conviction and thus the mind should be fixed on the Self alone and should think of nothing else', 'From wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the Self', 'The yogi whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest perfection of transcendental happiness He is beyond the mode of passion he realizes

restless and unsteady', 'The mind is restless turbulent obstinate and very strong O Krsna and to subdue it I think is more difficult than controlling the wind', 'Lord Sri Krsna said O mightyarmed son of Kunti it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind but it is possible by suitable practice and by detachment', 'For one whose mind is unbridled selfrealization is difficult work But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by appropriate means is assured of success That is My opinion', 'Arjuna said O Krsna what is the destination of the unsuccessful transcendentalist who in the beginning takes to the process of selfrealization with faith but who later desists due to worldlymindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism', 'O mightyarmed Krsna does not such a man who is bewildered from the path of transcendence fall away from both spiritual and material success and perish like a riven cloud with no position in any sphere', 'This is my doubt O Krsna and I ask You to dispel it completely But for You no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead said Son of Prtha a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual world one who does good My friend is never overcome by evil', 'The unsuccessful yogi after many many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities is born into a family of righteous people or into a family of rich aristocracy', 'Or if unsuccessful after long practice of yoga he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in wisdom Certainly such a birth is rare in this world', 'On taking such a birth he revives the divine consciousness of his previous life and he again tries to make further progress in order to achieve complete success O son of Kuru', 'By virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life he automatically becomes attracted to the yogic principles  even without seeking them Such an inquisitive transcendentalist stands always above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures', 'And when the yogi engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress being washed of all contaminations then ultimately achieving perfection after many many births of practice he attains the supreme goal', 'A yogi is greater than the ascetic greater than the empiricist and greater than the fruitive worker Therefore O Arjuna in all circumstances be a yogi', 'And of all yogis the one with great faith who always abides in Me thinks of Me within himself and renders transcendental loving service to Me  he is the most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all That is My opinion', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead said Now hear O son of Prtha how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me with mind attached to Me you can know Me in full free from doubt', 'I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge both phenomenal and numinous This being known nothing further shall remain for you to know', 'Out of many thousands among men one may endeavor for perfection and of those who have achieved perfection hardly one knows Me in truth', 'Earth water fire air ether mind intelligence and false ego  all together these eight constitute My separated material energies', 'Besides these O mightyarmed Arjuna there is another superior energy of Mine which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material inferior nature', 'All created beings have their source in these two natures Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world know for certain that I am both the origin and the dissolution', 'O conqueror of wealth there is no truth superior to Me Everything rests upon Me as pearls are strung on a thread', 'O son of Kunti I am the taste of water the light of the sun and the moon the syllable om in the Vedic mantras I am the sound in ether and ability in man', 'I am the original fragrance of the earth and I am the heat in fire I am the life of all that lives and I am the penances of all ascetics', 'O son of Prtha know that I am the original seed of all existences the intelligence of the intelligent and the prowess of all powerful men', 'I am the strength of the strong devoid of passion and desire I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles O lord of the Bharatas Arjuna', 'Know that all states of being  be they of goodness passion or ignorance  are manifested by My energy I am in one sense everything but I am independent I am not under the modes of material nature for they on the contrary are within Me', 'Deluded by the three modes goodness passion and ignorance the whole world does not know Me who am above the modes and inexhaustible', 'This divine energy of Mine consisting of the three modes of material nature is difficult to overcome But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it', 'Those miscreants who are grossly foolish who are lowest among mankind whose knowledge is stolen by illusion and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons do not surrender unto Me', 'O best among the Bharatas four kinds of pious men begin to render devotional service unto Me  the distressed the desirer of wealth the inquisitive and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute', 'Of these the one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best For I am very dear to him and he is dear to Me', 'All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider to be just like My own self Being engaged in My transcendental service he is sure to attain Me the highest and most perfect goal', 'After many births and deaths he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is Such a great soul is very rare', 'Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures', 'I am in everyones heart as the Supersoul As soon as one desires to worship some demigod I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity', 'Endowed with such a faith he endeavors to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone', 'Men of small intelligence worship the demigods and their fruits are limited and temporary Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet', 'Unintelligent men who do not know Me perfectly think that I the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna was impersonal before and have now assumed this personality Due to their small knowledge they do not know My higher nature which is imperishable and supreme', 'I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent For them I am covered by My internal potency and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible', 'O Arjuna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead I know everything that has happened in the past all that is happening in the present and all things that are yet to come I also know all living entities but Me no one knows', 'O scion of Bharata O conqueror of the foe all living entities are born into delusion bewildered by dualities arisen from desire and hate', 'Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion and they engage themselves in My service with determination', 'Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental activities', 'Those in full consciousness of Me who know Me the Supreme Lord to be the governing principle of the material manifestation of the demigods and of all methods of sacrifice can understand and know Me the Supreme Personality of Godhead even at the time of death', 'Arjuna inquired O my Lord O Supreme Person what is Brahman What is the self What are fruitive activities What is this material manifestation And what are the demigods Please explain this to me', 'Who is the Lord of sacrifice and how does He live in the body O Madhusudana And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at the time of death', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead said The indestructible transcendental living entity is called Brahman and his eternal nature is called adhyatma the self Action pertaining to the development of the material bodies of the living entities is called karma or fruitive activities', 'O best of the embodied beings the physical nature which is constantly changing is called adhibhuta the material manifestation The universal form of the Lord which includes all the demigods like those of the sun and moon is called adhidaiva And I the Supreme Lord represented as the Supersoul in the heart of every embodied being am called adhiyajna the Lord of sacrifice', 'And whoever at the end of his life quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature Of this there is no doubt', 'Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body O son of Kunti that state he will attain without fail', 'Therefore Arjuna you should always think of Me in the form of Krsna and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me you will attain Me without doubt', 'He who meditates on Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me undeviated from the path he O Partha is sure to reach Me', 'One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything as He who is the oldest who is the controller who is smaller than the smallest who is the maintainer of everything who is beyond all material conception who is inconceivable and who is always a person He is luminous like the sun and He is transcendental beyond this material nature', 'One who at the time of death fixes his life air between the eyebrows and by the strength of yoga with an undeviating mind engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord in full devotion will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead', 'Persons who are learned in the Vedas who utter omkara and who are great sages in the renounced order enter into Brahman Desiring such perfection one practices celibacy I shall now briefly explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation', 'The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head one establishes himself in yoga', 'After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om the supreme combination of letters if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body he will certainly reach the spiritual planets', 'For one who always remembers Me without deviation I am easy to obtain O son of Prtha because of his constant engagement in devotional service', 'After attaining Me the great souls who are yogis in devotion never return to this temporary world which is full of miseries because they have attained the highest perfection', 'From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place But one who attains to My abode O son of Kunti never takes birth again', 'By human calculation a thousand ages taken together form the duration of Brahmas one day And such also is the duration of his night', 'At the beginning of Brahmas day all living entities become manifest from the unmanifest state and thereafter when the night falls they are merged into the unmanifest again', 'Again and again when Brahmas day arrives all living entities come into being and with the arrival of Brahmas night they are helplessly annihilated', 'Yet there is another unmanifest nature which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter It is supreme and is never annihilated When all in this world is annihilated that part remains as it is', 'That which the Vedantists describe as unmanifest and infallible that which is known as the supreme destination that place from which having attained it one never returns  that is My supreme abode', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead who is greater than all is attainable by unalloyed devotion Although He is present in His abode He is allpervading and everything is situated within Him', 'O best of the Bharatas I shall now explain to you the different times at which passing away from this world the yogi does or does not come back', 'Those who know the Supreme Brahman attain that Supreme by passing away from the world during the influence of the fiery god in the light at an auspicious moment of the day during the fortnight of the waxing moon or during the six months when the sun travels in the north', 'The mystic who passes away from this world during the smoke the night the fortnight of the waning moon or the six months when the sun passes to the south reaches the moon planet but again comes back', 'According to Vedic opinion there are two ways of passing from this world  one in light and one in darkness When one passes in light he does not come back but when one passes in darkness he returns', 'Although the devotees know these two paths O Arjuna they are never bewildered Therefore be always fixed in devotion', 'A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas performing sacrifices undergoing austerities giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities Simply by performing devotional service he attains all these and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode', 'The Supreme Personality of Godhead said My dear Arjuna because you are never envious of Me I shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence', 'This knowledge is the king of education the most secret of all secrets It is the purest knowledge and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization it is the perfection of religion It is everlasting and it is joyfully performed',

form this entire universe is pervaded All beings are in Me but I am not in them', 'And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me Behold My mystic opulence Although I am the maintainer of all living entities and although I am everywhere I am not a part of this cosmic manifestation for My Self is the very source of creation', 'Understand that as the mighty wind blowing everywhere rests always in the sky all created beings rest in Me', 'O son of Kunti at the end of the millennium all material manifestations enter into My nature and at the beginning of another millennium by My potency I create them again', 'The whole cosmic order is under Me Under My will it is automatically manifested again and again and under My will it is annihilated at the end', 'O Dhananjaya all this work cannot bind Me I am ever detached from all these material activities seated as though neutral', 'This material nature which is one of My energies is working under My direction O son of Kunti producing all moving and nonmoving beings Under its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again', 'Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form They do not know My transcendental nature as the Supreme Lord of all that be', 'Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views In that deluded condition their hopes for liberation their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated', 'O son of Prtha those who are not deluded the great souls are under the protection of the divine nature They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead original and inexhaustible', 'Always chanting My glories endeavoring with great determination bowing down before Me these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion', 'Others who engage in sacrifice by the cultivation of knowledge worship the Supreme Lord as the one without a second as diverse in many and in the universal form', 'But it is I who am the ritual I the sacrifice the offering to the ancestors the healing herb the transcendental chant I am the butter and the fire and the offering', 'I am the father of this universe the mother the support and the grandsire I am the object of knowledge the purifier and the syllable om I am also the Rg the Sama and the Yajur Vedas', 'I am the goal the sustainer the master

and send forth the rain I am immortality and I am also death personified Both spirit and matter are in Me', 'Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice seeking the heavenly planets worship Me indirectly Purified of sinful reactions they take birth on the pious heavenly planet of Indra where they enjoy godly delights', 'When they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly sense pleasure and the results of their pious activities are exhausted they return to this mortal planet again Thus those who seek sense enjoyment by adhering to the principles of the three Vedas achieve only repeated birth and death', 'But those who always worship Me with exclusive devotion meditating on My transcendental form  to them I carry what they lack and I preserve what they have', 'Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me O son of Kunti but they do so in a wrong way', 'I am the only enjoyer and master of all sacrifices Therefore those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down', 'Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings and those who worship Me will live with Me', 'If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf a flower a fruit or water I will accept it', 'Whatever you do whatever you eat whatever you offer or give away and whatever austerities you perform  do that O son of Kunti as an offering to Me', 'In this way you will be freed from bondage to work and its auspicious and inauspicious results With your mind fixed on Me in this principle of renunciation you will be liberated and come to Me', 'I envy no one nor am I partial to anyone I am equal to all But

considered saintly because he is properly situated in his determination', 'He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace O son of Kunti declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes', 'O son of Prtha those who take shelter in Me though they be of lower birth  women vaisyas merchants and sudras workers  can attain the supreme destination', 'How much more this is so of the righteous

inconceivable unchanging fixed and immovable  the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth  by controlling the various senses and being equally disposed to everyone such persons engaged in the welfare of all at last achieve Me', 'For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested impersonal feature of the Supreme advancement is very troublesome To make progress in that discipline is
